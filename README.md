# LeetCodeStudy
A python script that gives me random leetcode questions from a Google Sheet
---
# How to run
Once you donwload the code run the command `python study.py`
It will prompt you for the number of easy, medium and hard questions you want.
It will open one question at a time starting with easy -> medium -> hard.
---
# Future plans
- I hope to add a category feature which will let you study questions from a given category
- Add in a hint/tips command that will print out the notes from the spreedsheet
- Have a section for Blind75 questions or choose between LeetCode patterns and Blind75

# Note
This is ment for people to use however they wish. The main objective is to get better at studying LeetCode problems.
I did not make this list, it is taken from [LeetCode Patters](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/). I thank them for helping make studying 10 times easier
